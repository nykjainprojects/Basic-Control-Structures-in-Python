This Repository contains basic python projects for beginners

### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
**Problem Statement**:  Write a Python program that:
1. 	Takes an integer input from the user.
2. 	Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. 	Displays the result accordingly.

```python
num= float(input("enter a number: "))

if num % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{num} is an even number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is an odd number")
```

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
 
**Problem Statement** : Write a Python program that:
1.   Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2.   Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3.   Displays the final sum.

```python
total = 0
for i in range(1,51):
    total = total + i
print(f"the sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: {total}")
```
